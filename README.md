# aoe2_top_trumps

This is the project I completed for the Code First Girls Python course. The program accesses the API for the game Age Of Empires II. It is a Top Trumps style game where the user plays against the computer - each player draws a random card from the 'deck', a statistic is chosen to be played (e.g. attack, line of sight, melee or pierce armour, or hit points) and the chosen statistic are compared (highest wins).

All 'cards' are related to units in the game (mainly military units, but also animals and villagers etc.). The game is a best of 3 rounds - round 3 is not executed if there is a winner after 2 rounds - and the scores for the game are saved to a text file.
